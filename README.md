Some notes about installing gitea.

## Introduction
As a complete newbie to gitea I'm going to keep some notes here about my
experiences when installing it. These will be organised in directories by the
host OS. Some forward planning just in case this experiment goes beyond the
first attempt.

- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](/ubuntu/ubuntu-1804-LTS/01-Installation.md)

### Update: 12 August 2019
Having just completed an HTTPS installation, it's time to rework the
configuration section: Gitea configurations are quite straightforward so I'm
going to create companion projects to demonstrate some practical
applications of git + gitea.

## Configuration
Here is a list of the configuration guides, these guides to build on one another
so it's advisable to at least give them a quick read in the intended order
before jumping ahead.

- [Initial Configuration](/configuration/01-InitialConfiguration.md)
- [Managing Users](/configuration/02-ManagingUsers.md)
- [Managing Organizations](/configuration/02-ManagingOrganizations.md)
- [Managing Repositories](/configuration/02-ManagingRepositories.md)
