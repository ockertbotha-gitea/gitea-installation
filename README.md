Some notes about installing gitea.

## Introduction
As a complete newbie to gitea I'm going to keep some notes here about my
experiences when installing it. These will be organised in directories by the
host OS. Some forward planning just in case this experiment goes beyond the
first attempt.

- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](/ubuntu/ubuntu-1804-LTS/README.md)

### Update: 14 May 2019
With what looks like a solid installation completed, it's time to take a closer
look at Gitea configuration, this too will end up in it's own folder structure.
